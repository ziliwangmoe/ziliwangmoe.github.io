<h1>All in AI</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Zili Wang (王梓里), I have a nickname Chamo(茶末). This name have double meanings. It is the name of the pet of magician in a Japanese manga (魔法老师). The pet is actully a ferret who knows a lot of things and can always give advice to his master. I like this kind of saga like characters. 茶末 also means the power of tea. I like the slice-of-life style animation and manga, and tea is the typical symbol of slice-of-life. </p>
<p>The most important dream from my childhood is about artifical intelligence. I believe the intelligence does not just belong to human but also to machine. Because what our brain doing has no difference with executing some algorithm, the feeling and emotion are nothing but a machanism to coordinate different demand in the algorithm. Like the computer need to decide which application get how much computation power. Ultimately, hopefull one day we can even transfer our own mind to a machine.<p>
<p>I also like the feeling of moe. This is a very strong feeling that a certain kind of people can get when they see the cute things, like the cute girl in 2D Japanese style CG. I always want to create the moe image based on my need. And I also like to be fluent in English, I can share ideas with any people in the world. My career is related to computer vision: mapping the real world to a virtual digital world.</p>
<p>And now, I find that they could all related to AI. I can train the AI to draw the moe image for me. This is the important area in AI: Ask AI to create something. And language is also the important part of intelligence. Using AI to practice foreign language or even prctice directly with a AI could help me get more insight of language. And the computer vision belongs to AI already and vision is the most foundamental element in intelligence. Almost all the creature have the ablility to abstract the complex world into some simple symbols like the language. If we cannot get any real intelligence in vision, it is very unlike to achieve any other real intelligence behavior， like speaking.</p>
<p>So, I have three major aeras in my persuit:</br>
<ul>
    <li>Create the AI that can draw moe things for me.</li>
    <li>Practice English with AI.</li>
    <li>Map the real world to the virtual digital world based on computer vision.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Create the AI that can draw moe things for me.</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Create the deep learning model which can tell the difference of be moe or not moe.</li>
    <li>Create the deep learning model which can color the draft.</li>
    <li>Create the deep learning model which can create moe charecter based on simple skeleton.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Practice English with AI.</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Create an app that I can practice listening skill. (<a href="https://blog.csdn.net/ziliwangmoe/article/details/82952310">Link</a>)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Map the real world to the virtual digital world based on computer vision.</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a system that I can map the real world anywhere with my iphone and locate myself in the virtual world created based on the data I upload.</li>
</ul>
