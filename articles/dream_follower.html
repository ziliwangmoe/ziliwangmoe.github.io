<h1>Opportunist and dream follower</h1>
<p>Someone always follows the path ahead of him and choose the best way when any forks show up, having no idea of and not caring where him will end up. Someone prefers to have his life all planed out in advance, knowing exactly where he will go in the end, but it is a very hard job for him to figure out the real goal of his life: too many things to balance out, too many unexpected events to take account of, too many bumps to pass over. That's why sometimes the former can go much further than the later.</p>

<p>In fact both ways of life make sense, which one do you belong to?</p>
