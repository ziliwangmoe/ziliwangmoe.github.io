<h1>Sense of existence: ultimate pursuit of human being</h1>
<p>These days a documentary has taken the Chinese Internet by storm. It is about the environmental problem, specifying on haze, namely PM2.5, that was made by investigative reporter, Jing Chai. At first, I did not bother to watch it, because I am not that kind of man having strong interest on public affair. For me, I care about the personal value a lot more, maybe it is because I am kind of technical guy. You know it is much more difficult to influence the whole society for technical guy than for the people working on journalism, politics and so on. I watched this documentary, because one of my friends with whom I just have had a debate about the impact of haze on working out. My friend insisted that the impact of haze is so serious that we should give up any physical exercises and keep still as possible as we can. But I think that since there is no solid result showing that doing physical exercises under the condition of the quality of air of China will lead to great raise of rate of fetal health problems, maybe the benefit bringing by working out lives out the damages caused by the haze.</p>

<p>After my friend watched the documentary, he strongly recommended it to me. So, I watched it too and found it a masterpiece. It is very emotional, and my eyes were filling with tear all the way through it. In fact, the documentary does not give the well-established quantitative result about how serious the impact of haze to the human. All the words about the impact are like, suspect, maybe. But the fact we know is that the haze, PM2.5, for sure has negative influence on us and if the influence grows to certain level, it will be fetal. And it is a problem relates to everyone in the world. You can shut out anything you do not like if you have enough money. But you have no choice but breathe the same air as anyone else. We often have different attitudes to a problem, because we are from different groups. But for the problem of haze, we can kind of agree on that it is bad.</p>

<p>The reason that I think environmental problem is special is that the harm to our body is just the surface of the problem. In the back, it is caused by many other problems, like the system of government, development of economic, corruption of official, structure of energy, lifestyle, value of our life and so on. Some problems are so sensitive that people normally avoid talking about them. Since we are all equal in front of haze and affected by it greatly, it is easier for us to discuss about it, and further on discuss other problems related to it.</p>

<p>As I said I care more of personal value than the issue of public, the most impressive aspect of this event of Jing Chai for me is the motivation of making this documentary. People are talking about everywhere that she funded the project herself and did this project as whole time job for a couple of years, and she has devoted all herself into the public affair. What she has been doing is not the things normal people want to do. In my opinion, for sure she has done something good for the public, but she also achieved her personal value effectively too. Personal value is a very abstractive word. In my understanding, it refers to the sense of existence. We may value some totally different things, money, fame, achievement and so on. We want them because they can show our existence in the world. The life of human is so brief, saving for the necessary need, we really want to make the world know us somehow or leave something after we no longer exist. Once I asked one of my colleagues that why he wanted the second baby. His answer was simple: I want more people to think of me after I am dead. We work so hard to earn money, if it is luck, someone will earn a lot of money, so he can have anything he wants. But he still works very hard for his enterprise, just because he wants to influence more people. That is why Ma of Alibaba and Ma of Tencent never stop their enterprise. For the common people, we dream about big house, luxury stuffs, doing good things, showing off our special abilities, special achievement and so on. Just because we want others to respect and know us. Even some people do something very bad just in order to increase their sense of existence. In case of Jing Chai, she was suddenly known by almost all the people in China, got the possibility of changing the country, did good thing for the whole population and delivered her idea to everyone in the country. All these can bring her huge sense of existence. Surely she has been the model of achieving personal value.</p>

<p>Indeed, the life is so brief. We really need to focus on the things that can enhance our existence in the world. It does not mean that everyone should do something can change the world. Each one can find its own way of showing its existence. The key is focus, perseverance. Because it is not an easy job to leave something in the world, most of the creatures that have ever been in the world left no traces of its existence.</p>
