<h1>Modern Familyï¼šAmerican version of therapeutic style</h1>
<p>Last year when I decided to intensively train my English listening ability, I needed to find the materials suited for my favorite and learning English too. It was not an easy job. I finally chose the American TV series Modern Family as my training material.  If what I am studying is Japanese, things would have got much easier. What my point is the American culture is huge different from the culture I have been accustomed to and liked. </p>
 
<p>Indeed, the aesthetic between East and West are huge different. For Japanese ACG (Animation, Comic and Game), you can find lot of things are only concerned with girls, daily life, small talks, no male, no love affair, no plot, no funny point, no thoughts. What is the routine in American TV series: making out, dating, party, drinking and jokes. At first, I tried to apply the principles of my favorite style to the American TV series to find the one I liked. With no result, I understood that I have to try to accept the news things now if I wanted to move on. It would be hard for me, but maybe I can have some baby steps at first. And Modern Family is right my baby step.</p>
 
<p>Making people emotional is the best words to describe this TV series. At beginning, you have a lot of laughter, and than suddenly everything gets out of control, fighting, quarreling and yelling. You feel nervous, but just when you think the tension is too much, and what you want is watching something makes you relax, the story turns to be moving and your tear bursts out suddenly. When you think this is all, some jokes just pop out before your tear even gets dry.</p>
 
<p>If the content is too routine, you will feel boring; if the story pops into your head too many thoughts, you feel serious; if the plot is too dramatic, you get a lot of stress; if too many sarcastic and hilarious things, you laugh a lot, but nothing else leaves. I'd like to say that Modern Family balances all of these very well and actually I think it surpasses many Japanese animations I love. Though for sure there is no that kind of kawaii loli in it, but as I keep watching, I am starting to feel a different kind of beauty in it. Haley is beautiful and Lily is adorable, I really have the feeling.</p>
 
<p>Some words in Modern family are so pretty that I have the strong intention to recite them. As a TV series with more than seven sessions, you cannot count on where will be something great insightful there. The plays are obviously hinged on the taste of public, political ideology and techniques of developing script. The joke at the end of each episode keeps reminding us that do not take the drama too seriously. But it can really tell us the value of parents, of lover, of kids, of offspring which are all the things we know very well but sometimes we may kind of ignore them. These are all told not by preaching but by the vivid stories of three exceptional but typical families. This is the most impressive point of Modern family. It uses the most common elements in our daily life, ingeniously organizes them into amazing stories which arouse the strong emotion of us toward the things in our own living.</p>
 
<p>Just take couple of examples. Haley and the nanny of Jay's family, Andy, who was a boy with similar age of Haley were totally not in the same league. In fact they looked down with each other all the time. Andy had a girlfriend who was not perfect, but Andy did a lot of things for her even she did not care too much. Meantime, Haley was dating a boy with extremely cute appearance and super fortune but who cannot meet Haley on time and who did not bother to get off car to pick Haley at the door of house and who honked to tell his coming. At last, Andy insisted to fly to his girlfriend even when his girlfriend broke with him. He said he believed that was not the true thought of his girlfriend. Yes, caring and trust is another important thing in affection. Haley understood this and was impressed on this and so do the viewers.</p>
 
<p>Another example is about the commencement of Alex's middle school. Alex is very academic but geek too. Giving speech on the commencement is a rare chance she can show off in front of other cool kids who she belittles all the time. So she decided to turn it to a big scene and humiliate those kids, "It's ironic that I stand up here, representing my classmates when, for the past three years, most of them have treated me like I'm invisible." Her sister Haley tried her best to prevent Alex's plan, but Alex was too set in her revenge to see how small-minded she was. As Haley finally gave up Alex, Alex hesitated at the words, "It's ironic that I stand up here representing my classmates" and go on with the words, "when...they're so...awesome...They should be up here themselves." Tears rushed out instantly at the point.</p>
