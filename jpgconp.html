<h1>Study of JPEG compression algorithm</h1>
<h2 class="subTitle">Background</h2>
<p>This is a project in Multimedia class taught by Prof. Dan Schonfeld. The goal of project is to understand JPEG compression and 2-D discrete cosine transform in great depth.</p>
<h2 class="subTitle">Compression process</h2>
<p>1. The image is subdivided into many blocks with size of 8*8 pixel</p>
<p>2. The value of every pixel was subtracted by 128</p>
<p>3. Apply 2-D discrete cosine transform to the block.</p>
<p>4. Quantize the block. After quantization the high frequency components are reduced.</p>
<p>5. Generate the 1-D sequence used for serialization with the zigzag pattern.</p>
<p>6. Process all other blocks as above</p>
<h2 class="subTitle">Compression rate and SNR</h2>
<p>
Compression rate: 1-M/m<br>
SNR=P/Pe<br>
M: the bytes which the jpeg use to represent image<br>
m: the bytes to store the image directly, which is 256*256 bytes<br>
P: the power of the image P=sum(illumination of each point)^2<br>
Pe:the power of the noise Pe=sum(difference of illumination of each point before and after compression )^2</p>

<p class="figDesc">Fig.1 Size:3266 Bytes  Compression radius: 95%  SNR:750</p>
<img src="img/jpgcomp/image004.jpg" />
<p class="figDesc">Fig.2 Size:8759 bytes  Compression radius: 87%  SNR:311</p>
<img src="img/jpgcomp/image006.jpg" />
<p class="figDesc">Fig.3 Size:10919 bytes  Compression radius: 83%  SNR:143</p>
<img src="img/jpgcomp/image008.jpg" />
<p class="figDesc">Fig.4 Size:14510 bytes  Compression radius: 78%  SNR:91</p>
<h2 class="subTitle">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The result shows that the simpler of image, the higher of the compression rate and higher SNR</p>
