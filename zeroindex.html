<h1>Enhancement of self-collimated fields in photonic crystals consisting of two kinds of single-negative materials</h1>
<p>Enhanced homogeneous fields are realized in a zero-index medium embedded in Bragg reflectors.
When the zero-index medium has Kerr-type nonlinearity, the threshold for optical bistability can
be reduced noticeably due to the enhanced uniform fields. Based on a transmission line, we
fabricate an effective zero-index medium sandwiched in electric and magnetic walls and
experimentally demonstrate the enhanced nearly uniform fields.</p>
