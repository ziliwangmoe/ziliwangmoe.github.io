<h1>Online EXPO 2010: Virtual exhibition of Leshan City</h1>
<p>In 2010, EXPO 2010 was held in City of Shanghai. There were realistic pavilions for the big countries. But for many small cities of China, there are virtual exhibition hall which you can navigate online. And these virtual halls compose another important part of EXPO 2010 which is the Online EXPO 2010.</p>
<p>Leshan is one of big city in my hometown Sichuan province and has its own virtual hall in the Online EXPO 2010. I was lucky to have the chance to be in charge of the project of building virtual exhibition of Leshan City for Online EXPO 2010. The modeling work was outsourcing and I did all other work: designing the layout of hall; importing the mode to the engine; making the code.</p>
<p>In fact this was my first time of using 3d engine to make a scene where people can navigate in it. I studied all the required skills and knowledge on my own. It was seemed impossible at first, because I was a student major in Physics that time and had no any computer graphic background. The project lasted about two month including the time I studied various things. I did it during my winter vocation when I studied in Tongji University.</p>
<p>The 3D engine I used is Virtool which was the only option stipulated by the official. Compare to the cutting-edge game engine, like Unity3d, Unreal, CryEngine, it was really suck. But one of my dreams in my childhood is to make a 3d scene which I can walk in it. So, I did this project with very great passion. </p>
