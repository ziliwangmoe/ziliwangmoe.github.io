Many applications have to be based on the high accuracy of position, like autonomous driving, indoor robot, drone. At this moment, the best solution is to combine the image and IMU which are off the shelf device and also get relatively practical accuracy at the same time. Another idea is the separation of mapping and tracking process. So we can utilize the past information to get more accurate position. And refine the map incrementally each time a user use it. By doing so, we can build very large scale and even dynamic map. And this technique is the intrinsic need for many emerging application, so thatâ€™s why I am pretty interesting in it.
