<h1>Enhancement of self-collimated fields in photonic crystals consisting of two kinds of single-negative materials</h1>
<p>Self-collimations are found in one-dimensional (1D) photonic
crystals consisting of two kinds of single-negative materials that effectively
cancel each other out. Compared to the self-collimations in all-dielectric
photonic crystals or 1D photonic crystals with negative-index materials, this
kind of structure can amplify both far and near fields greatly during
collimation.</p>
